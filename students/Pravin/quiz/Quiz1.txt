}

var employee = {
  name:"tom",
  getName: function(){console.log("employee"+this.name);}
}

var run= student.getName.bind(employee);

run()

Answer:- studenttom

Explaination:- in this we are using bind method. It creates a new function by borrowing the method from another variable or object. in this it borrows name from employee variable as we pass the variable in bind method like .bind(employee).



Question 3 what will be the output and why?

x=10;
function foo(x){
  x=20;
  delete x;
  return x;
}
console.log(foo(5))

Answer:- 20

Explaination:- in this question we are passing the value as 5 but inside the function we are re assining the value of x as 20 and in case of value delete will not work it remove a property from an object. and we are returning x .




Question 4 what will be the output and why?

function foo(){
  var a;
  console.log(a)
  a=10;
}
foo()

Answer:- Undefine

Explaination:- We can not initializing the value of the variable after the deceleration.


Question 5 What Does a Filter Do?

function evenodd(n){
  return n%2 !=0;
}
myarray=[1,2,3,4,5]

console.log(myarray.filter(evenodd))

Answer:- myarray=[1,3,5]

Explaination:- it filter the given array on the basis of the condition provided in the function pass the every item through the condition an gives a new array. in above problem we given a condition to get an odd number of array so the output is myarray = [1,3,5].


Question 6 what is output and why?

var myarray = ['80', '90', 100];

function compare (a,b){
  return a-b;
}

var a=myarray.sort();
var b = myarray.sort(compare);


console.log(a===b)

Answer:- True myarray = ['80', '90', 100]

Explaination:- The value and the data type of both is same at the every index of the array.



Question 7 what will be the output and why?


myfruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
const [a, ...b] = myfruit

console.log(a)
console.log(b)

Answer:- a= apple and b= ['banana','orange']

Explaination:- here array destructuring is used with rest operator by assigning with the index value of the array with a and b ... these three dots represent as rest and spread operator we are using the rest here which add the rest of the item in b .


Question 8 what will be the output and why?


printMe();

function printMe(){
  console.log("hello from function.")
}

var obj = new PrintMeToo();

obj.printMe();

class PrintMeToo{
  printMe(){
    console.log("hello from class")
  }
}

Answer:- hello from function. and Uncaught ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'PrintMeToo' before initialization.

Explaination:-  the first function printMe() executes but the class object shows error of lexical decleration because Class obj can be created after class declaration. as below.

class PrintMeToo{
  printMe(){
    console.log("hello from class")
  }
}


var obj = new PrintMeToo();

obj.printMe();
