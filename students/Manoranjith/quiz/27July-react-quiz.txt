action to the Store then store will updated and triggered to the view(UI), so that flow is 
Action->Dispatch->Store->View

Why because of if we real dom it will has a so much weight and it will also rerender the entire page,
that's why react introduced Virtual DOM , for light weight deploment , and render the sperate element / object and Also good performance
	
7	Which of the following acts as the input of a class-based component

,So Props act as the input of the ClassBasedComponent.

	
8	What is a state in React

Ans: B) Internal storage of the component
Explanation: 
State is used to built in react object and that will shared in to the react component (local component).

	
9	Regarding React js components, which of following statement is true
A	function components can have state
B	function components are light weight
C	class components are light weight
D	class components are faster than function component

Ans: B) function components are light weight
Explanation: 
React functional components are light weight and are faster that class components
	
10	To update state in react functional component which hook is used

Javascript script statement will be in to the curled paranthesis {}
	
16	class component must include the _______ statement.
A	extends React.Component
B	extends React
C	extends Component
D	extends React.Component.All

Ans: A) extends React. Component
Explanation: 
The component has to include the extends React. Component statement, this statement creates 
an inheritance to React. Component, and gives your component access to React. Component's functions.
	
17	Consider the below function – which is the correct syntax of arrow function
Msg = function() {
  return Good Morning;
}
A	Msg = () = {return Good Morning;}
B	Msg = () = Good Morning;
C	Both A. and B.
D	None of the above

Ans: C) Both A & B
Explanation: 
Arrow function () => { }
	
18	What is Reconciliation
A	The process through which React deletes the DOM.
B	The process through which React updates and deletes the component.
C	It is a process to set the state.
D	The process through which React updates the DOM.

Ans: D) The process through which React updates the Dom.
Explanation : Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM. 
React use a “diffing” algorithm so that component updates are predictable and faster.

	
19	Controlled Component vs Uncontrolled Component
A	Controlled Components every state mutation will have an associated handler function; Uncontrolled Components store their own states internally
B	Controlled Components store their own states internally; Uncontrolled Components every state mutation will have an associated handler function
C	Controlled Components A component who is so good at controlling itself; Uncontrolled Components A component who has no idea how to control itself
D	Controlled Components every state mutation does not have an associated handler function; Uncontrolled Components does not store their own states internally
	
Ans: A) : Controlled Components: every state mutation will have an associated handler function; Uncontrolled Components: store their own states internally
Explanation : 
handleChange(events) {
  this.setState({ value: event.target.value.toUpperCase() })
} 
In this case, every value will be printed in uppercase letters, which is the toUpperCase(), 
an associated function handler.


20	What is the “key” prop
A	“Key” prop is just there to look pretty and there is no benefit whatsoever.
B	“Key” prop is a way for React to identify a newly added item in a list and compare during the “diffing” algorithm.

Explanation : 
the reason we would get the the “missing key” warning because React needs the “key” prop 
to identify any new item in a list when re-rendering.
