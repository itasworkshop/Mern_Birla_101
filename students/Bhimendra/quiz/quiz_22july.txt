a. const
b. var
c. let

	We use const because we can't reassign the value as well as can't redeclare the variable. Therefore can't change the declared data.

7. What will be the output of the following code snippet?

<script type="text/javascript">
a = 5 + "9";
document.write(a);
</script>

a. Compilation Error
b. 14
c. Runtime Error
d. 59
Ans--->d. 59
	Here the concadination takes place. because we are adding a datatype of number with string. addition has two property concadination and adding.

8. What will be the output of the following code snippet?

<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  
var a = "Scaler";
var result = a.substring(2, 4);
document.write(result);

a. al
b. ale
c. cal

var x=12;
var y=8;
var res=eval("x+y");
document.write(res);
 
</script>
a. 20
b. x+y
c. 128
d. None
Ans--->a. 20
	eval  evaluates an argument

10. 
When the switch statement matches the expression with the given labels, how is the comparison done?
a. Both datatype and the result of the expression are compared.
b. Only datatype is compared
c. Only the value of the expression is compared
d. None
Ans--->a. Both datatype and the result of the expression are compared.


11. What keyword is used to check whether a given property is valid or not?
a. in
b. is in
c. exists
d. lies

              noscript is a tag that defines a browser that doesn't support script tag.


13. 
What will be the output of the following code snippet?

(function(){
 setTimeout(()=> console.log(1),2000);
 console.log(2);
 setTimeout(()=> console.log(3),0);
 console.log(4);
})();
a. 1234
b. 2341
c. 2431
d. 4321
Ans--->c. 2431
	When it comes to output console.log is always executed first then setTimeout. Because setTimeout will be stored in a callStack for its execution to be completed even if its timing is of 0sec. So we get a output as 2431. 

14. 
What will be the output of the following code snippet?

(function(a){
 return (function(){
   console.log(a);
   a = 6;
 })()
})(21);

a. 6
b. NaN
c. 21
d. None
Ans--->c. 21
	As we are passing a value of a as 21. and a=6 is assigned to a after  console.log a value does not change. if a=6 would be first initialized then call console.log(a) then the answer would be 6.


15. What will be the output of the following code snippet?

function solve(arr, rotations){
 if(rotations == 0) return arr;
 for(let i = 0; i < rotations; i++){
   let element = arr.pop();
   arr.unshift(element);
 }
 return arr;
}
// solve([44, 1, 22, 111], 5);
a. [111,44,1,22]
b. [44,1,22,111]
c. [111,44,1,22]
d. [1,22,111,44]
Ans--->[111,44,1,22]
