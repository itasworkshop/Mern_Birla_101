JavaScript
--> open source used to bring more interactivity in our web application. JS is used for client side as well as server side web application devlopment.

Web application
client ------request--------> 
<--response--------- server

client --> some one who is requesting
server --> someone who is entertaining that request coming from client

1) JS is dynamic typed language
it means no need to tell type of variables upfront
a = 10;
//a = "Rajesh";

console.log("Hello World!!!!!");
console.log(typeof(a));

2) var, let and const
redecalaration --> only var is allowed

reassignment of const is not allowed

--> creating function in JS
function add(a,b){
  console.log(a+b);
}

add(10,20);

--> var is functional scope and let is block scope
var p=10;

function testLetAndVar(){
  var p = 20;
  
  console.log("p is ",p);
}

console.log(p);

testLetAndVar();


function testLetAndVar(){
  var x = 20;
  {
  	let f = 30;
    console.log("f is ",f); //available only within block
  }
  
  console.log("x is ",x);
  console.log("f is ",f); //not available outside block
}


testLetAndVar();

//() => {}
//result = myarray.map( i => i*i);

result = myarray.reduce((a,b) => a+b);
