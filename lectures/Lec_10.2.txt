REST API

API --> application programing interface
how one software component communicates with another one

REST --> 
Representational State Transfer protocol

--> used to describe architecure style or web services
--> Restful --> any system that is implementing rest standards
--> not related any language

REST principles
1) Uniform Interface --> for all components , same interface, URI
2) Client-Server --> sepearte of concern
server - store and manipulate data
client - request, display the response
3) Stateless Interaction/Transaction --> all information about each request is within that request
4) Cacheable --> client and server can cache resources/temporary store
5) Layered Architure --> directly client to end server or intermediate load-balancer.
6) Code on Demand --> client can download code


Client-Server -- system perspective
MVC architecture -- app design

Request/Response
HTTP --> Hyper Text Tranfer Protocol
how client and server talks to each other

Request Methods
1) GET --> read action[ retrives a resource]
2) POST --> create action[creating a new resource]
3) PUT --> updating action[updating existing resource]
4) DELETE --> delete action[deletes a resource]

which methods are idempotent?
answer:- GET,PUT,Delete request is idempotent, POST is not idempotent because it create new resource with same call same data.

--> what is idempotent? 
answer:- same call can be made multiple times without producing different result.

Response Codes:-
GET - 200 - OK
POST - 201 - Created
PUT - 200 - OK
DELETE - 200(OK), 202(Accepted), 204(No content)

REST API Endpoints
endpoint --> URL of the request that can accept GET,POST,PUT,DELETE request.

Root Endpoint:-
http://api.mypizza.com/v2

Path
/users
/user/5

Query
?location=delhi&age=21

http://api.mypizza.com/users?limit=10


Q) what is difference between Restful and Restless API?
ans: RestFul means which is following REST standards, HTTP methods, JSON,HTML ect, use large bandwidth
		RestLess --> not following , SOAP, uses XML documents for communication, small bandwidth
